// Intro to Variables

// Variables can store information
// we can use that information later 
// we can change that information later as well 

// Declare a varibale
var firstName = "Hello Rishh";

// Use a variable
console.log(firstName);

// Changing the value of variable
// We don't need to write var again var is used to just declare variable
firstName = "Mohit";
console.log(firstName);



// "use strict"; is used if we don't want to create variable without var tag
